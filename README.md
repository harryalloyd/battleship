In this instance, I'm player John and so I shoot/attack Harry's side of the board.
Each player alternates their shots so you cannot fire multiple times per turn.
The white squares indicate shots that missed and red squares indicate shots that successfully hit.

After one player has managed to hit all of their opponent's squares that represent a ship, they have won and are prompted with an option to rematch. 
If both players decide to rematch, the game restarts from the beginning.
